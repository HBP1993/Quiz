Create a Weapon Class definition according to the following specs:

Attributes:

name - user supplied
bullets - random number between 10 and 100000
speed - user supplied
range - user supplied
status - 'Active' (this attribute should be changed to 'Inactive' if bullets 
                    run out.)

Methods:

Create accessor methods for each attribute.

Create a method named 'fire_bullet' that will simulate
firing a bullet. This is accomplished by decreasing the number of bullets by 1 
every time the method is called. When the bullet count reaches zero, it should change
the attribute 'status' to 'Inactive'
